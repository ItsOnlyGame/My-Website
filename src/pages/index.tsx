					<p>
						I'm a second-year student at Turku University of Applied Sciences. I'm studying Information and communications technology. I
						like to game, hang out with friends, and program weird and useful things.
					</p>
					<p>
						After I got my first laptop at the age of 10, I started learning how to program with Java being my first language. I got started
						by watching YouTube tutorials. After I felt confident, I began to create my own game, but after a while my interest shifted to
						learning different programming languages.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, I began to pick up more languages like Python, JavaScript and C++ and created some small projects with them. During
						2020, I got the opportunity put my skills into use by creating a website for a client. At this point the ball of web
						developement started rolling.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I've mostly been playing around as a fullstack developer with Nuxt or React in the frontend and NestJS or Express.js in the
						backend.
					</p>
					<p>Even today, I am still learning more and more. One day I will become a computer wizardðŸ”®</p>
