					<p>
						I'm a second-year student at Turku University of Applied Sciences. I'm studying Information and communications technology. I'm
						eager to learn new things about my field and have a wide variety of skills under my belt.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've always been interested in computers and technology, which led me to become computer literate. I started learning how to
						program at the age of 10, with Java being my first language.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I have taken more of an interest in web development. I've mostly been playing around as a fullstack developer with Nuxt and
						React in the frontend and NestJS and Express.js in the backend.
					</p>
					<p>Even today, I am still learning more and more. One day I will become a computer wizardðŸ”®</p>
